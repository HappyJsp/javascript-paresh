/*

There are eight basic JavaScript data types:

String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. For example, "Hello" or 'JavaScript'.
Number: A numeric value, including both integers and decimals. For example, 10, 3.14, or -100.
Bigint: An integer that can represent numbers larger than those that can be represented by the Number data type. For example, 12345678901234567890n.
Boolean: A logical value that can be either true or false. For example, true or false.
Undefined: A value that represents the absence of a value. For example, the value of a variable that has not been initialized is undefined.
Null: A value that represents the intentional absence of a value. For example, a variable that is explicitly set to null indicates that it has no value.
Symbol: A unique and immutable value that can be used as a property key. Symbols are often used as identifiers for private data or methods.
Object: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be any JavaScript data type. Objects are used to store and organize data in JavaScript.

/*magine a shoebox filled with various items. Each item in the box has a label that helps you identify it. This box represents an object in JavaScript, and the items inside represent the object's properties. Each property has a name (like the label on the item) and a value (like the item itself).*/
